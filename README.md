# Torch_Simulator
The Torch Simulator is a MATLAB app which has been developed to predict the parameters of the Radio-Frequency (RF) Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) including axial temperature, electron number density, ion number density, ionization percentage, neutral atom number density, and robustness. The Torch Simulator is able to quickly calculate and provide the plasma parameters of interest within a few seconds for the conventional Fassel torch. To run the Torch Simulator, the user is not required to have any prior CFD knowledge and is only prompted to provide the values of operating conditions, including gas flow rates, sample uptake rate, power, injector size, elements of interest, and spray chamber efficiency.
